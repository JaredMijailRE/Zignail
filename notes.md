# Sockets
## theory
https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/what-is-a-socket.html#what-is-a-socket

-  everything in linux is a file, for communication over the internet we use a file descriptor
- to get a file descriptor we use, socket(), we could use read() and write() because it is a file, but better to use send() and recv()
- there are many sockets, DARPA (internet sockets), Unix sockets...
- there are many types of internet sockets
  - stream sockets: SOCK_STREAM, use by ssh, telnet, all arrives in the same order, error-free
    HTTP, uses stream sockets to get pages
    It uses TCP/IP, TCP makes sure data is error-free and in order, IP deals with routing
  - datagram sockets: SOCK_DGRAM, also call connectionless sockets
    all packages may not arrive, and they arrive in desorder, use by tftp and dhcpcd
    build on top of UDP/IP, it is faster, you dont have to mantain an open connection

- OSI, data is wrapped, in many layers, that encapsulat the data in headers

## practice
so how do we create a socket in Zig? https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.os.linux

in this case only for linux, we use the standar library, os.linux, where the sockets are.

*socket*: (domain: ip address family, socket_type: stream or datagram, protocol: when we support multiple protocol)
